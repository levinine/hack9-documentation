	<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
	<p>
		These are the questions that most of you have asked. We hope this document
		will clarify your doubts. Please check regularly, you may come to realize
		that there was some misunderstanding.
	</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>What is the "Initial"?</dt>
		<dd>
			Initial is the initial "cost" of the call, expressed in a number of
			seconds that will be pre-added to the call duration.
		</dd>
		<dt>What is "Increment"?</dt>
		<dd>
			Increment factor is expressed in seconds, just like the initial factor.
			Each price entry has two factors which affect how the effective and, thus,
			chargeable duration of the call is calculated: initial duration (in
			seconds) and increment (in seconds).
			<br>
			The recorded duration is increased by the <em>initial</em> and then it is
			rounded <strong>up</strong>, to the factor of <em>increment</em>.
			<br>
			So, if we had a call that lasted 53s and the price entry applicable has
			initial=20s and increment=10s, the effective duration of the call would be:
			20s + 53s = 73s, which will be rounded up to 80s (the first number greater
			or equal to 73, divisible by 10).
		</dd>
		<dt>What Invoice ID format do we expect?</dt>
		<dd>
			The only requirement for invoice IDs is that they are unique. How any team
			constructs them is up to them. There are some possibilities, like:
			<ol>
				<li>${sequence}-${telephone}</li>
				<li>${master_id}-${telephone}</li>
				<li>${UUID}</li>
				<li>INV-${period}-${user_id}</li>
			</ol>
		</dd>
		<dt>
			If a call starts in a cost period and ends in a different one, how they
			approach the costs computation?
		</dt>
		<dd>
			The price used to calculate the cost of the call is the one that matches
			The start of the call.
		</dd>
		<dt>Are the functional tests using invalid phone numbers and/or periods?</dt>
		<dd>
			If your API receives price request for a number that is not covered by the
			configuration, the API should respond with "HTTP 404 Not found".
			If a client (Judge Thread) submits a call to recorded with non-existing
			phone number, API should respond with "HTTP 400 Bad request".
		</dd>
		<dt>How do we do the load test?</dt>
		<dd>Log into Judge Thread and initiate a test run</dd>
		<dt>Is there a "warm up" period for the tests?</dt>
		<dd>There's no warmup period.</dd>
		<dt>Do we do a even request distribution for the entire load test of an end-point?</dt>
		<dd>
			We have N concurrent threads which hammer the API. Each of them is making
			requests sequentially.
		</dd>
		<dt>What max load should we expect for an end-point like in request/second?</dt>
		<dd>
			RPS depends on the API speed. We will run 250 threads with total 6
			million of requests.
		</dd>
		<dt>Do the load tests using the same data for all performance tests in all runs?</dt>
		<dd>No</dd>
		<dt>
			About the listing/calling end-points are from and to parameters inclusive
			or exclusive?
		</dt>
		<dd>Inclusive. It is a point in time, with 100th of a second precision, anyway.</dd>
		<dt>
			What if a potential call hasn't ended by the time provided in to do we
			partially calculate it?
		</dt>
		<dd>Start of the call is always used in the calculation.</dd>
		<dt>
			If invoice has been requested, should it include calls that have already
			been invoiced?
		</dt>
		<dd>
			Invoice is a financial document, it details financial obligation between
			two parties - client and telephone company, in this case. If a portion of
			service given to the client (telephone calls) has already been invoiced, it
			must not be invoiced again.
			<br>
			So, the short answer is "no".
		</dd>
		<dt>Are the numbers in examples of Swagger specification with quotations?</dt>
		<dd>
			This was a mistake in the swagger YML. The numbers that represent numerical
			values should be without quotation marks. Phone numbers are <strong>strings</strong>
			They are still surrounded with quotation marks.
		</dd>
		<dt>API mentions that price returned from /switch/price yields price per second</dt>
		<dd>
			<strong>This is an error in documentation.</strong> The price returned
			should be, as schema document states, price per minute.
		</dd>
		<dt>We want to limit IP access to our solution</dt>
		<dd>
			If you wish to restrict access to your solution, this is the current list
			of test runners.
			<ul>
				<li>ec2-34-254-196-227.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com</li>
				<li>ec2-18-202-25-22.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com</li>
				<li>ec2-54-246-231-163.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com</li>
			</ul>
			Keep in mind that this list may change, if we decide to add more test
			runners to distribute the load. In that case, you will need to broaden the
			IP whitelist or open up completely.
		<dt>Is duration in CallCost schema an integer or a string?</dt>
		<dd>
			<strong>This is an error in Swagger documentation.</strong> Duration should be of a type string.Swager documenation is updated now whit this correction.
		</dd>
